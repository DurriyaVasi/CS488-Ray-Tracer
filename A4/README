Compilation:
	1. Compilation is the same as default. Program should be run from the directory of the source code.
	2. Lab machine used to test the code is: gl23
	3. Code is locally tested on Mac machine with OS X El Capitan 10.11.2.

Manual:
	1. Nonhier renders perfect. No error in phong illumination model.
	2. There are some lighting problem in hier mode. I think the normal might not get correctly transformed back. Otherwise, hier renders fine.
	3. Extra feature implemented is anti-aliasing. Two images are provided for comparison. nonhier_antialiasing.png vs nonhier_without_antialiasing.png
	4. I have modified plane.obj manually. The old obj file has a wrong normal.
	5. I have added a prefix of “Assets/“ to all obj string in lua. So that the binary can properly load objects without having to run it inside Assets folder.
	6. Some lua scene has been modified to increase resolution from 256x256 to 1024x1024. Rendering those image might take some time.
	7. All pre-generated png files are in the Assets folder.
